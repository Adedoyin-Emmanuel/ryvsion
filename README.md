## Question 1

What do I understand about the problem and how do I solve it.

## Key Challenges & Solutions\*\*

## Managing Large Volumes of Data

**Challenge**: Efficiently storing, retrieving, and updating large datasets (products, users, transactions).
**Solution**: Using a scalable database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL with an ORM like Prisma or Sequelize, implementing indexing for faster queries, and considering database sharding or replication for high availability. Also the concept of trasactions will be used to ensure data integrity.

## Ensuring a Responsive and Fast User Experience

**Challenge**: The platform must load quickly and handle real-time updates smoothly.
**Solution**: Optimize backend processing with efficient algorithms, using GraphQL to prevent API Overfetching. Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data, and leverage Next.js for server-side rendering to improve frontend performance.

## Integrating Secure Payment Gateways

**Challenge**: Securely process payments, complying with standards like PCI DSS.
**Solution**: Use established payment processors like Stripe,Paypal, Squad, Square, Chimoney or Paystack, ensuring data encryption, tokenization of payment details, and secure transmission over HTTPS.

## Implementing Real-Time Features

**Challenge**: Provide live search, real-time stock updates, and a seamless user experience.
**Solution**: Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication between the client and server.

Technology Stack Overview
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Frontend: React with Next.js
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (using socket.io)
Payment Integration: Stripe or PayPal API
