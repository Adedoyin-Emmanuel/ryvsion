# Ryvsion Assessment

## Question 1

What do I understand about the problem and how do I solve it.

## Managing Large Volumes of Data

**Challenge**: Efficiently storing, retrieving, and updating large datasets (products, users, transactions).
**Solution**: Using a scalable database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL with an ORM like Prisma or Sequelize, implementing indexing for faster queries, and considering database sharding or replication for high availability. Also the concept of trasactions will be used to ensure data integrity.

## Ensuring a Responsive and Fast User Experience

**Challenge**: The platform must load quickly and handle real-time updates smoothly.
**Solution**: Optimize backend processing with efficient algorithms, using GraphQL to prevent API Overfetching. Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data, and leverage Next.js for server-side rendering to improve frontend performance. We can also use a new concept called **Local First** approach with ElectricSQL. This will also help with the UX ensuring any action performed locally is synced with the server when the user is back online.

## Integrating Secure Payment Gateways

**Challenge**: Securely process payments, complying with standards like PCI DSS.
**Solution**: Use established payment processors like Stripe,Paypal, Squad`s Payment APIs or their SDK which I built <https://github.com/adedoyin-emmanuel/squad-js-sdk>, Square, Chimoney or Paystack, ensuring data encryption, tokenization of payment details, and secure transmission over HTTPS.

## Implementing Real-Time Features

**Challenge**: Provide live search, real-time stock updates, and a seamless user experience.
**Solution**: Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication between the client and server.

**Technology Stack Overview**
**Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
**Frontend**: React with Next.js
**Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
**Real-Time Communicatio**n: WebSockets (using socket.io)
**Payment Integration**: Stripe, PayPal API, Squad or Paystack

## Question 2

Product Search API (Node.js)
We can implement a simple product search API using Node.js and Express.js. Here’s an example:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 2800;

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

// Define the Product schema
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  stock: Number,
});

const Product = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);

// Product search API
app.get("/api/products", async (req, res) => {
  const { query } = req.query;
  try {
    const products = await Product.find({
      $or: [
        { name: new RegExp(query, "i") },
        { description: new RegExp(query, "i") },
      ],
    });
    res.json(products);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Server Error" });
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Viewing a Single Product (Next.js)

Here’s how we can implement a page in Next.js to view a single product:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

const ProductPage = ({ product }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
      <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>
      <p>Stock: {product.stock}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { id } = context.params;
  const response = await axios.get(`${process.env.API_URL}/products/${id}`);
  return { props: { product: response.data } };
}

export default ProductPage;
```

## Environment Variables

**MONGODB_URI** and **API_URL** default values.

**MONGODB_URI** = mongodb://localhost/ecommerce-app
**API_URL** = <http://localhost:2800/api> `assuming our backend api is running on PORT 2800`
